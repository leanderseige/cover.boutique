1. get a scan of the phone's back that is truly 600dpi
2. roughly trim the image
3. rotate the image so that it is perfectly up right
4. rectangle-select the backplate of the phone
5. use round corner to modify the selection to match the actual form
6. shrinken the selection a little bit if necessary
7. turn the selection into a 5px border
8. create a transparent layer
9. fill the selected border black
10. repeat select-round-fill with camera holes etc
11. select the outside of the template, invert the selection and extend by 100px
12. trim the image to the selection so you finally have the template with 100px padding
13. hide the background photo and save as transparent png
14. save xcf for later edits
